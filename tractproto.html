      <h1>Jesus, the Missing Piece</h1>
      <h3>THE UNIVERSE</h3>
      <p>
        Many people think that the universe just happened, that the big bang
        just occurred for no reason; that humans were created simply by random
        processes of evolution.
      </p>
      <h3>GOD CREATED IT</h3>
      <p>
        This is not true. God created the world<a class="sup" href="#fn1">1</a>
        through his son, Jesus Christ.<a class="sup" href="#fn2">2</a>
        Jesus is the origin, the sustainer and also the final purpose of all the
        pieces of the universe. Because of Jesus, the universe is not random or
        chaotic, but obeys mathematical laws. Finely tuned. Humans came into
        existence on a planet of life - because God planned it.
      </p>
      <h3>GOD HIDES</h3>
      <p>
        The bible - the book written by humans, but inspired by God - says that
        God is a “God who hides himself”<a class="sup" href="#fn3">3</a>.
        Nevertheless he was and is always there working often invisibly behind
        the scenes through his son, Jesus Christ<a class="sup" href="#fn4">4</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>ADAM AND EVE PUNISHED</h3>
      <p>
        Because of their disobedience, the first humans Adam and Eve were cast
        out of paradise<a class="sup" href="#fn5">5</a> and punished with
        death<a class="sup" href="#fn6">6</a>. All their descendants inherited a
        predisposition to sin from them<a class="sup" href="#fn7">7</a>, and
        became destined for eternal death<a class="sup" href="#fn8">8, </a
        ><a class="sup" href="#fn9">9</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>MESSIAH PROMISED</h3>
      <p>
        God wanted to rescue humankind from these consequences<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn10"
          >10</a
        >. He promised he would one day send a special person, a mysterious
        “messiah” to rescue mankind<a class="sup" href="#fn11">11</a>. He said
        it was important that people trusted in and obeyed the messiah when he
        came<a class="sup" href="#fn12">12</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>MESSIAH A MYSTERY</h3>
      <p>
        Through his prophets, he told people in advance what the signs would be
        so that everyone could recognise him<a class="sup" href="#fn13">13</a>,
        and even at what time he would come<a class="sup" href="#fn14">14</a>.
        But many things were still hidden, a “mystery”<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn15"
          >15</a
        >. The prophets and even angels in heaven thought hard about this,
        trying to decode God’s clues<a class="sup" href="#fn16">16</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>BORN IN BETHLEHEM</h3>
      <p>
        One clue was that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem in Israel<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn17"
          >17</a
        >. And then when the messiah was about to be born, 2000 years ago, God
        sent a special star to lead the way to him<a class="sup" href="#fn18"
          >18</a
        >. Wise men from the East followed the star and found the young Messiah,
        Jesus Christ, in Bethlehem<a class="sup" href="#fn19">19</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>GOD WITH US</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, Jesus had become a human being of flesh and blood<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn20"
          >20</a
        >, God with us. The invisible “missing piece” had suddenly become
        visible at a particular time in history<a class="sup" href="#fn21"
          >21, </a
        ><a class="sup" href="#fn22">22</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>MIRACLES</h3>
      <p>
        When the Messiah grew up, he started doing miracles, which were further
        signs to prove to people who he was<a class="sup" href="#fn23">23</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>HATED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS</h3>
      <p>
        Some people recognised that he was the one we must follow<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn24"
          >24</a
        >, but others - in particular the religious leaders of the time - did
        not recognise that he was the Messiah<a class="sup" href="#fn25">25, </a
        ><a class="sup" href="#fn26">26</a> or want to follow him<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn27"
          >27</a
        >, but rather they wanted to kill him<a class="sup" href="#fn28">28</a>.
        They didn’t recognise him because the Devil had blinded their eyes to
        the truth<a class="sup" href="#fn29">29</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>JESUS CRUCIFIED</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually they did kill him<a class="sup" href="#fn30">30</a>. They
        arranged for the Romans, who ruled the world at that time, to nail him
        to a cross of wood, murdering him in the most painful manner<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn31"
          >31</a
        >. But this did not catch God out unawares. God had already planned that
        this would happen<a class="sup" href="#fn32">32</a> so that he could
        forgive humans<a class="sup" href="#fn33">33</a> and enable them to come
        back to a friendship with Him again<a class="sup" href="#fn34">34</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>RESURRECTION</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus was then resurrected from the dead<a class="sup" href="#fn35"
          >35</a
        >, which was a sign that humans would eventually be resurrected too<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn36"
          >36</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>GREAT COMMISSION</h3>
      <p>
        He instructed his followers (“disciples”) to tell others about him and
        persuade them to follow him too<a class="sup" href="#fn37">37</a>…
      </p>
      <h3>SAUL CONVERTED</h3>
      <p>
        One of the religious leaders, called Saul, hated the Christians and went
        about imprisoning and killing them<a class="sup" href="#fn38">38</a>.
        One day a blinding vision of Jesus knocked him down. The vision asked
        Saul, “Why are you persecuting me?” But Saul didn’t recognise who it was
        until the vision revealed that he was Jesus<a class="sup" href="#fn39"
          >39</a
        >. The final piece of the puzzle fell into place for Saul, and he became
        a follower of Jesus too<a class="sup" href="#fn40">40</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>IDOLS IN ATHENS</h3>
      <p>
        One of the places where Saul tried to make disciples was Athens in
        Greece<a class="sup" href="#fn41">41</a>. They had lots of temples there
        and lots of different idols - gods of stone and metal and wood that they
        bowed down to<a class="sup" href="#fn42">42</a>. But they did not know
        about Jesus - the only one truly worthy of worship.
      </p>
      <h3>AN UNKNOWN GOD</h3>
      <p>
        However, there was one altar that Paul noticed, which had written on it
        “To an unknown God”<a class="sup" href="#fn43">43</a>. Maybe the
        Athenians had a feeling that there was a mysterious God behind the
        scenes that they didn’t yet know about but that nevertheless required
        their worship?
      </p>
      <h3>IT’S JESUS!</h3>
      <p>
        Saul said “The one you worship as unknown, I now declare to you.” And he
        told them all about Jesus.
      </p>
      <h3>MEN MUST REPENT</h3>
      <p>
        Saul explains: “Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times,
        He now commands all people everywhere to repent.”<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn44"
          >44</a
        >
        In other words, men must abandon the bad things they are doing and the
        other things they are worshiping, and trust in Jesus to rescue them<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn45"
          >45</a
        >, obeying him as their Lord<a class="sup" href="#fn46">46</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>HEAVEN OR HELL?</h3>
      <p>
        This is so important as otherwise they are destined for judgment and
        eternal torment in hell<a class="sup" href="#fn47">47, </a
        ><a class="sup" href="#fn48">48</a>. For those who believe, there is
        eternal life awaiting and joy with Jesus in heaven<a
          class="sup"
          href="#fn49"
          >49, </a
        ><a class="sup" href="#fn50">50</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>IDOLS TODAY</h3>
      <p>
        So what about you? Look around at the idols where you are - temples and
        statues but also shopping centres and sports arenas? Family and romantic
        relationships? Personal beauty? Business success? God demands that all
        things must take second place to Jesus. Will you turn away from
        worshiping other things and make Jesus number one in your life? If you
        want to do this, then pray the following prayer with your whole heart
        and Jesus will accept you.
      </p>
      <h3>TURNING TO JESUS</h3>
      <p>
        “Dear Jesus, I am sorry for the bad things I have done in my life and
        the other things I have put before you. Please forgive me. I turn away
        from these things and put my trust in you, making you Lord of my life.
        Thank you for your forgiveness, love and acceptance, which you promise
        to all who come humbly to you.” Did you pray the prayer? Do you want to
        find out more about Jesus and what Christians believe? Please leave a
